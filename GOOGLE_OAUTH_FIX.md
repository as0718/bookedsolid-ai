# Google OAuth Configuration Guide

## ‚úÖ LOCAL ENVIRONMENT - FIXED!

The local environment now works correctly with automatic user creation.

---

## üîß PRODUCTION (NETLIFY) - CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Find Your Netlify URL

Your Netlify app is deployed at a URL like:
- `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`
- OR your custom domain if configured

### Step 2: Configure Netlify Environment Variables

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard > Site settings > Environment variables**

Add/Update these variables:

```bash
# Required for NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here

# Google OAuth (same as local)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

# Database (SQLite for simplicity)
DATABASE_URL=file:./prod.db

# Other required variables
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe2025!
```

**CRITICAL:** Replace `https://your-app-name.netlify.app` with your actual Netlify URL!

### Step 3: Update Google Cloud Console

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID from Google Cloud Console
3. Click on it to edit
4. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
https://your-app-name.netlify.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `your-app-name.netlify.app` with your actual Netlify domain!

5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Deploy Changes

After setting environment variables in Netlify:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard > Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" > "Deploy site"
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 5: Test Production

1. Visit your Netlify URL: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app/login`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Select your Google account
4. You should land on the dashboard! üéâ

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch" Error

**Solution:** The redirect URI in Google Cloud Console doesn't match your domain.
- Double-check the redirect URI in Google Console matches exactly
- Format: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
- Wait 30 seconds after saving for changes to propagate

### Issue: Page Refreshes, Can't Select Google Account

**Solution:** NEXTAUTH_URL is missing or incorrect in Netlify
- Go to Netlify > Site settings > Environment variables
- Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your Netlify domain exactly
- Re-deploy after making changes

### Issue: "Invalid JWT Token" or Session Errors

**Solution:** NEXTAUTH_SECRET is missing
- Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set in Netlify environment variables
- Use the same secret: `Xh5bjmGTIcnOTJTGAxuyMaLJ4pubxBDBHtSNL5a5ghM=`
- Re-deploy after making changes

### Issue: User Lands Back on Login Instead of Dashboard

**Solution:** This was the original bug, now fixed!
- The code now automatically creates a User and Client when signing in with Google
- If you still see this, ensure the latest code is deployed

## üìã Quick Checklist

### Local Development ‚úÖ
- [x] Code updated with signIn callback
- [x] Google OAuth redirect URI includes localhost:3000
- [x] .env file has correct credentials
- [x] Dev server running
- [x] Test: Google login ‚Üí Dashboard works

### Production (Netlify) üîß
- [ ] Find Netlify URL
- [ ] Set NEXTAUTH_URL in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Set NEXTAUTH_SECRET in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Set Google OAuth credentials in Netlify
- [ ] Add production redirect URI to Google Console
- [ ] Trigger new deployment
- [ ] Test: Google login ‚Üí Dashboard works

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Never commit .env files** - They're in .gitignore for a reason
2. **Use different secrets for production** - Currently using the same for demo
3. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Especially if exposed
4. **Enable Google OAuth consent screen** - Configure in Google Cloud Console

---

## üìû What Happens When a User Signs in with Google?

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. Redirected to Google account selection
3. User selects account and grants permissions
4. Google redirects back to `/api/auth/callback/google`
5. **NEW:** Our `signIn` callback checks if user exists:
   - If NO: Creates new User + Client with trial subscription
   - If YES: Loads existing user data
6. User is logged in with JWT session
7. Redirected to `/dashboard` with full access

## üéØ Next Steps After OAuth is Working

Once OAuth is working in both environments:

1. **Configure Business Logic**
   - Set up Vapi.ai or Retell.ai integration
   - Configure Stripe for payments
   - Set up webhook endpoints

2. **Production Hardening**
   - Switch to PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
   - Add rate limiting
   - Configure email verification
   - Set up monitoring and logging

3. **User Experience**
   - Add email verification flow
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Add user profile management
   - Add subscription management
