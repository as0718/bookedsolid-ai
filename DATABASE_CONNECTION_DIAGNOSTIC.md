# Database Connection Diagnostic Report

## Problem Identified

The Supabase database server cannot be reached because the hostname does not resolve in DNS:

```
Host: db.mfndswtgocyzmbvsrbdu.supabase.co
Error: Unknown host (DNS lookup failed)
```

## What This Means

The Supabase project reference ID `mfndswtgocyzmbvsrbdu` either:

1. **Project doesn't exist** - The project was never created or has been deleted
2. **Project is paused** - Supabase pauses inactive projects on the free tier
3. **Incorrect reference ID** - The project reference ID is wrong

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Check Your Supabase Dashboard

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects

Check:
- Does the project exist?
- Is it active (not paused)?
- What is the actual project reference ID?

### Step 2: Get the Correct Connection String

If the project exists:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/settings/database
2. Look for "Connection string" section
3. Select "URI" format
4. Copy the COMPLETE connection string (it includes the password)

If the project is paused:
1. Click "Resume Project" in the dashboard
2. Wait for it to become active (may take 1-2 minutes)
3. Then get the connection string

If the project doesn't exist:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Note the project reference ID
3. Get the connection string from settings

### Step 3: Update Your .env File

Once you have the correct connection string, update `.env`:

```bash
# Replace BOTH lines with your actual connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT_ID].supabase.co:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT_ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
```

**Important**:
- Make sure the project reference ID matches your actual Supabase project
- URL-encode special characters in password ($ becomes %24, @ becomes %40, etc.)

## Testing the Connection

After updating the .env file, test the connection:

```bash
# Test if the host resolves
ping db.[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co

# If ping works, try pushing the schema
npx prisma db push
```

## Current Configuration Attempted

```
Host: db.mfndswtgocyzmbvsrbdu.supabase.co
Port: 5432 (direct) / 6543 (pooling)
Database: postgres
User: postgres
Password: 2016144475Hempire90$ (URL-encoded as %24)
```

## Next Steps After Connection Works

Once you can connect to Supabase:

1. Run migrations: `npx prisma db push`
2. Verify schema: `npx prisma studio`
3. Update Vercel environment variables with the same connection strings
4. Deploy to production
5. Test all features on production

## Why This Migration Is Critical

Your current SQLite database (`prisma/dev.db`) resets on every Vercel deployment because serverless platforms don't persist file-based databases. This is why production shows old data despite successful code deployments.

PostgreSQL (Supabase) will provide:
- Persistent storage across deployments
- Scalable production database
- Connection pooling for better performance
- Real-time capabilities (if needed later)

**Status**: Waiting for correct Supabase connection string from user
