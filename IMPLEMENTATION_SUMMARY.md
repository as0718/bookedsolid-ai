## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure Stripe (Required)

1. Get your Stripe test keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Open `.env.local` and replace placeholder values:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
   ```
3. Create 3 subscription products in Stripe Dashboard (see `STRIPE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
4. Add all 6 Price IDs to `.env.local`

### Step 2: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Server should already be running!
# If not:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with Google OAuth or create an account
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ Setup modal appears on first login
   - ✅ Shows three subscription plans
   - ✅ Monthly/Annual toggle works
   - ✅ "Subscribe Now" redirects to Stripe Checkout
   - ✅ "Setup Later" dismisses modal with confirmation
4. Go to billing page: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/billing
   - ✅ No "configuration missing" error
   - ✅ Plans display correctly
   - ✅ Can click "Subscribe Now"

### Step 4: Test Stripe Checkout

Use test cards:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- More cards: https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards

### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment instructions.

**Quick checklist:**
1. ✅ Add all environment variables to Netlify dashboard
2. ✅ Set up Stripe webhook endpoint
3. ✅ Deploy and test
4. ✅ Verify setup modal appears for new users
