# Vercel Production Deployment with PostgreSQL

## Migration Successfully Completed

Your database has been successfully migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Supabase)!

**What was fixed:**
- SQLite databases reset on every Vercel deployment
- Production data was being lost between deployments
- Now using PostgreSQL for permanent, persistent storage

**Database Status:**
- ✅ All 11 tables created in Supabase
- ✅ Migration tracking initialized
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel environment variable update

---

## Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel project settings:
**https://vercel.com/as0718s-projects/dashboard/settings/environment-variables**

### Add These TWO Variables:

#### Variable 1: DATABASE_URL
```
DATABASE_URL
```
**Value:**
```
postgresql://postgres:2016144475Hempire90%24@db.mfndswtgocyzmbvsrbdu.supabase.co:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&sslmode=require
```
**Environment:** Production, Preview, Development (select all three)

#### Variable 2: DIRECT_URL
```
DIRECT_URL
```
**Value:**
```
postgresql://postgres:2016144475Hempire90%24@db.mfndswtgocyzmbvsrbdu.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```
**Environment:** Production, Preview, Development (select all three)

---

## Step 2: Trigger Production Deployment

After adding the environment variables, Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push code. Since we just pushed the PostgreSQL migration, you have two options:

### Option A: Wait for Automatic Deployment
Vercel may automatically pick up the latest push and start deploying. Check your deployments page:
https://vercel.com/as0718s-projects/dashboard/deployments

### Option B: Manual Deployment (Recommended)
If you want to trigger it immediately:

```bash
cd "/Users/alansine/Downloads/Voice Agent/dashboard"
vercel --prod
```

Or create an empty commit to trigger deployment:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment with PostgreSQL"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Production Database

Once deployment completes, verify that your production app is using PostgreSQL:

1. Visit your production URL: **https://bookedsolid-ai.vercel.app**
2. Try logging in (Google OAuth or credentials)
3. Check that data persists after a new deployment
4. Test creating a new user/client and verify it's saved

---

## What Happens on Deployment

When Vercel builds your app with PostgreSQL configured:

1. **Environment variables** are loaded from Vercel settings
2. **Prisma generates** the client with PostgreSQL types
3. **Migrations run** automatically (if using `prisma migrate deploy`)
4. **App connects** to Supabase PostgreSQL database
5. **Data persists** across all future deployments

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build fails with database connection error

**Solution:** Make sure both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` are added to Vercel environment variables with the correct values (including the URL-encoded password with `%24` instead of `$`).

### Issue: Data still resetting

**Solution:** Verify the environment variables are set for "Production" environment in Vercel. Check the deployment logs to ensure Prisma is connecting to PostgreSQL, not SQLite.

### Issue: "P1001: Can't reach database server"

**Solution:** Your Supabase project may be paused. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects and resume the project.

### Issue: Migration errors on deployment

**Solution:** The migrations are already applied to your Supabase database. You may need to update your build command in `vercel.json` to use `prisma db push` instead of `prisma migrate deploy` for the initial deployment.

## Current Database Contents

Your Supabase PostgreSQL database currently has:
- **11 tables** created and ready
- **0 users** (empty - will be populated as users sign up)
- **0 clients** (empty - will be populated as clients are created)

All your new features are ready to work with persistent data:
- Team management
- Appointment scheduling
- CRM with voice clients
- Subscription management
- Usage analytics

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

Once production is running with PostgreSQL:

1. **Test all features** to verify they work with the new database
2. **Monitor logs** for any database connection issues
3. **Set up automated backups** in Supabase dashboard (optional)
4. **Consider enabling RLS** (Row Level Security) for additional security (optional)

## Production URL

Your production deployment will be available at:
**https://bookedsolid-ai.vercel.app**

(Vercel may also assign additional preview URLs for each deployment)

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment once environment variables are added ✅
